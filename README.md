## Kurtis Key's Code Sample

This quick code sample is a complete mobile-ready responsive 'ToDo' application. Built using a mobile-first approach, and implementing media queries for larger displays later in the development process, the design works well on any size screen.

This project was completed using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript+jQuery, and PHP. 

The user interface was built using W3C-valid HTML5, making use of the new custom 'data-' attributes and semantic markup tags.

Styling of the UI was done using CSS3, employing many new features such as pseudo-elements+selectors, imageless gradients and border-radius.

The usage of the localStorage API was applied using plain-old JavaScript in the form of the 'NoteToSelf' object(/js/NoteToSelf.js) allowing for client side storage and offline application usage by eliminating the need for server-side storage. while the interface was enhanced using a combination of jQuery and CSS3 animations, also allowing dynamic content without the need for a single page refresh.

However, using PHP5/MySQL/PDO with a side of AJAX/JSON, I also implemented server-side storage. Using AJAX, PHP and jQuery communicate in JSON in order to save your local todo list on the web server, also allowing you to load them from the MySQL database at any time.
